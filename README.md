 8HP Eurorack Prototyping Board for Thuhole or SMT
 
 I got tired of cutting perfboard to size and wiring up the same power supply every time I made a custom eurorack module so I designed this simple prototyping PCB. I find 8HP works very well for small projects - any more complex and I don't want to hand wire it.
 The board has a grid of holes on .1" centers which accomodates DIP packages, thruhole parts, PJ301 type jacks and 9mm pots very nicely. The power header, protection diodes, bypass and bulk decouping caps are prewired and there is a ring of GND holes around the perimeter. Adjacent to the power supply are 5 holes each for wiring +-12V. My favorite way to use this is put the chips in sockets on the panel side of the board 0603 size SMT parts on the bottom side. I use wire wrap wire to hook everything up.
 
 
 Check out my repository for gerbers of a companion 8HP FR4 blank panel. It has copper both sides for strength. You can solder some standoffs or wires to it this for attaching the protoboard if you don't have pots, jacks etc to bolt the panel to the board. It has my initials on one side but you can just turn it over or design your own with this nifty tool: https://delptronics.com/mcs-panel-maker.php
